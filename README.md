# CLV-Customer-Segmentation-RFM
This project focuses on calculating Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) using a cohort-based approach for a more accurate and actionable analysis. Leveraging SQL, Tableau and Google Sheets, the analysis includes weekly revenue per user, cumulative revenue trends, and future revenue predictions for 12-week cohorts. 

Key insights are presented through interactive visualizations, conditional formatting, and comprehensive trend analysis. This repository highlights advanced cohort analysis techniques to improve business decision-making and predict revenue growth effectively.
